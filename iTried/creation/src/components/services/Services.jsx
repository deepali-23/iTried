                I offer in-depth manual testing to ensure the functionality,
                usability, and stability of applications. This includes test
                case creation, execution, and documentation to identify defects
                before production.

                I perform functional testing to validate that the applicationâ€™s
                features work as expected according to the requirements. This
                includes testing user interactions, workflows, and overall
                functionality.

                I perform regression testing to ensure that new changes, bug
                fixes, or features don't negatively affect existing
                functionality, ensuring the stability of the application
                throughout the development lifecycle.

                I evaluate the application's usability to ensure it provides an
                intuitive and user-friendly experience. I focus on navigation,
                design elements, and ease of use to ensure it aligns with user
                expectations.

                I conduct exploratory testing to identify issues that may not be
                covered by test cases or automated scripts. This approach
                leverages creativity and experience to uncover hidden defects or
                unexpected behaviors.

                I thoroughly document and report bugs or issues using
                bug-tracking tools like JIRA or Trello, providing detailed steps
                to reproduce the issue and working closely with developers to
                facilitate quick resolution.
